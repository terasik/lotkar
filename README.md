# Lotti Karroti game

i'm trying to create a popular children game *Lotti Karroti* with python arcade library. 

## Thanks 

thanks to [arcade team](https://api.arcade.academy/en/stable/index.html) for arcade python library

thanks to [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/) for rabbit images!


## TODO's

- get windowsize from window object, not from defs.py
- menu view with settings (how many players, which colors, ..)
